## Introduction

The Web Testing Service (WTS) is a web server that hosts the comprehensive
web test suites and supports users to run them online through Browsers or
Web Runtimes. Its backend also provides the web servers such as wpt server,
web socket server and some test media content; its frontend is a friendly
web page to customize tests, control testing, and show test results.
